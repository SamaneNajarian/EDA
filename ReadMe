 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project demonstrates the core steps of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python.  
The goal is to understand the structure, patterns, and quality of a dataset through both statistical summaries and visualizations.

 📌 Objectives

- Load and inspect a dataset
- Perform basic statistical analysis
- Identify missing values
- Explore feature distributions and relationships
- Visualize data using Matplotlib and Seaborn

 📁 Dataset

The dataset used in this notebook includes a mix of numerical and categorical variables.  
It is a real-world-like dataset suitable for practicing data exploration and preprocessing.

 🧰 Tools & Libraries

- Python 3.x  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  

 📊 Key Steps

1. Loading the Data  
   Reading the dataset into a DataFrame using pandas.

2. Initial Exploration  
   Reviewing shape, columns, types, and sample data.

3. Missing Values  
   Detecting and deciding how to handle missing data.

4. Descriptive Statistics  
   Exploring summary metrics like mean, median, and standard deviation.

5. Visualization  
   - Histograms and boxplots for distribution  
   - Heatmaps for correlation analysis  
   - Countplots for categorical features

 ▶️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
