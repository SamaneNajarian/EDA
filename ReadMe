Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

This project demonstrates the core steps of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python.  
The goal is to understand the structure, patterns, and quality of a dataset through statistical summaries and visualizations.

📌 Project Objectives

- Load and inspect the dataset  
- Perform basic statistical analysis  
- Identify and handle missing values  
- Explore feature distributions and relationships  
- Visualize data using Matplotlib and Seaborn

📁 Dataset

The dataset used in this project comes from a Kaggle competition called [Don't Get Kicked!](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/DontGetKicked).

Due to Kaggle's data sharing policy, the dataset is not included in this repository.  
To use the notebook:

1. Download the dataset manually from the Kaggle competition page.
2. Place the downloaded file (e.g., training.csv) in a folder named data/ inside this repository.
3. Make sure the file path in your notebook matches this location:

`python
data = pd.read_csv('data/training.csv')
